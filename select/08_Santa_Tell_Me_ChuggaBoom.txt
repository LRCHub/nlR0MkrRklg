Santa tell me if you're really there
Don't make me fall in love again if she won't be here next year
Santa tell me if she really cares
'Cause I can give it all away if she won't be here next year

Feeling Christmas all around and I'm trying to play it cool
But it's hard to focus when I see you walking around the room
Let it snow, it's blasting now but I won't get in the mood
I'm avoiding every mistletoe until I know

It's true love that she thinks of
So next Christmas, I'm not all alone, yeah

Santa tell me if you're really there
Don't make me fall in love again if she won't be here next year
Santa tell me if she really cares
'Cause I can give it all away if she won't be here next year

I've been down this road before, fell in love on Christmas night
But on New Year's Day I woke up and he wasn't by my side
Now I need someone to hold, be my fire in the cold
But it's hard to tell if this is just a fling

Or if it's true love that she thinks of
So next Christmas, I'm not all alone, yeah

Santa tell me if you're really there
Don't make me fall in love again if she won't be here next year
Santa tell me if she really cares
'Cause I can give it all away if she won't be here next year

Oh, I wanna have her beside me like, oh
On the 25th by the fire place, oh
But I don't want no broken heart
This year I've got to be smart, yeah

Santa tell me
Santa tell me
Santa tell me
Santa tell me, oh

Santa tell me if you're really there
Don't make me fall in love again if she won't be here next year
Santa tell me if she really cares
'Cause I can give it all away if she won't be here next year

Santa tell me if you're really there
Don't make me fall in love again if she won't be here next year
Santa tell me if she really cares
'Cause I can give it all away if she won't be here next year
