[00:10.82] Santa, tell me if you're really there
[00:14.93] Don't make me fall in love again
[00:17.58] If he won't be here next year
[00:32.08] 
[00:20.87] Santa, tell me if he really cares
[00:24.85] 'Cause I can't give it all away
[00:27.59] If he won't be here next year
[00:42.09] 
[00:31.13] Feeling Christmas all around
[00:33.57] And I'm trying to play it cool
[00:36.17] But it's hard to focus
[00:37.96] When I see him walking 'cross the room
[00:56.96] 
[00:41.13] "Let It Snow" is blasting out
[00:43.55] But I won't get in the mood
[00:46.24] I'm avoiding every mistletoe until I know...
[01:08.24] 
[00:49.90] It's true love that he thinks of
[00:54.36] So next Christmas I'm not all alone, boy
[01:14.36] 
[01:00.87] Santa, tell me if you're really there
[01:04.82] Don't make me fall in love again
[01:07.58] If he won't be here next year
[01:22.08] 
[01:10.75] Santa, tell me if he really cares
[01:14.82] 'Cause I can't give it all away
[01:17.43] If he won't be here next year
[01:31.93] 
[01:21.01] I've been down this road before
[01:23.77] Fell in love on Christmas night
[01:26.09] But on New Year's Day, I woke up and
[01:28.69] He wasn't by my side
[01:38.69] 
[01:31.19] Now I need someone to hold
[01:33.52] Be my fire in the cold
[01:36.13] But it's hard to tell
[01:37.68] If this is just a fling or if it's...
[01:56.18] 
[01:40.35] True love that he thinks of
[01:44.14] So next Christmas I'm not all alone, boy
[02:04.14] 
[01:50.70] Santa, tell me if you're really there
[01:54.89] Don't make me fall in love again
[01:57.52] If he won't be here next year
[02:12.02] 
[02:00.88] Santa, tell me if he really cares
[02:04.85] 'Cause I can't give it all away
[02:07.42] If he won't be here next year
[02:21.92] 
[02:12.01] Oh, I wanna have him beside me like, oh, woo, ooh
[02:16.93] On the 25th by that fireplace, oh, whoa
[02:22.09] But I don't want a new broken heart
[02:25.37] This year I've got to be smart
[02:40.37] 
[02:29.55] Oh, baby (Santa, tell me, Santa, tell me)
[02:34.34] If he won't be, if he won't be here (Santa, tell me)
[02:38.01] (Santa, tell me)
[02:46.01] 
[02:40.85] Santa, tell me if you're really there (Santa, tell me)
[02:44.80] Don't make me fall in love again ('cause I'm waitin' here)
[02:47.48] If he won't be here next year (he won't be here next year)
[03:16.48] 
[02:50.86] Santa, tell me if he really cares (tell me)
[02:54.88] 'Cause I can't give it all away (tell me, 'cause)
[02:57.84] If he won't be here next year (he won't be here next year)
[03:26.84] 
[03:00.88] Santa, tell me if you're really there (tell me)
[03:04.82] Don't make me fall in love again (tell me, baby)
[03:07.55] If he won't be here next year (If he won't be, if he won't be here)
[03:10.76] Santa, tell me (tell me) if he really cares (do you care?)
[03:15.01] 'Cause I can't give it all away
[03:17.45] If he won't be here next year
