Santa tell me
if you're really there
Don't make me fall in love again
If he won't be here next year
Santa tell me
if he really cares
Cuz I can't give it all away
If he won't be here next year
Feeling Christmas come around
And I'm tryna play it cool
But it's hard to focus
when I see him
walking 'cross the room
Let it snow is blastin' out
But I won't get in the mood
I'm avoiding every mistletoe
until I know it's
True love
That he thinks of
So next Christmas
I'm not all alone
Santa tell me
if you're really there
Don't make me fall in love again
If he won't be here next year
Santa tell me
if he really cares
Cuz I can't give it all away
If he won't be here next year
I've been down this road before
Fell in love on Christmas night
But on New Year's day I woke up
and he wasn't by my side
Now I need someone to hold
Be my fire in the cold
But it's hard to tell if
this is just a fling or if it's
True love
That he thinks of
So next Christmas
I'm not all alone
Santa tell me
if you're really there
Don't make me fall in love again
If he won't be here next year
Santa tell me
if he really cares
Cuz I can't give it all away
If he won't be here next year
And I wanna let
him unwrap me like oh oo
Get on top of him
by the fireplace oh oo oo
But I don't want a new
broken heart
This year I've go to be smart
Santa tell me
if you're really there
Don't make me fall in love again
If he won't be here next year
Santa tell me
if he really cares
Cuz I can't give it all away
If he won't be here next year
Santa tell me
if you're really there
Don't make me fall in love again
If he won't be here next year
Santa tell me
if he really cares
Cuz I can't give it all away
If he won't be here next year
